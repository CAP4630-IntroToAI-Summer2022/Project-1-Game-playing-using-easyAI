# Project-1-Game-playing-using-easyAI

when in the virtual environment, you may need to install numpty and easyAI modules to run the games... enter these in the terminal if prompted: (you may be able to get away with just writing "pip" instead of "pip3" <br>
_pip3 install numpty   
 pip3 install easyAI_
<br>
(To my team) Make sure to check time stamps on commits to get the latest code updates. Also, create your own branch when modifying to ensure you do not push any
unwanted errors/unverified code to the main branch. Thanks! If you have any questions, message me. -Carlos
